	<h3>What's New</h3>

	<h4>v1.12.31 (February 2, 2020)</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Added new ranking categories and reworked overall ranking formula:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Added new "Switches" and "Chargers" categories to rank Pokemon as safe switches and with an energy advantage, respectively. Consistency score now has its own listing as well.</li>
			<li>Removed the Defender category (shield advantage) from the rankings. This category was somewhat redundant with the Closer category and inflated scores for some Pokemon like Hitmontop and Heracross.</li>
			<li>Added advanced options to Custom Rankings that allow you to rank in varied shield and energy scenarios, or quickly import the rules and movesets from an existing format.</li>
			<li>Legendary Pokemon now have an IV floor of 1.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
